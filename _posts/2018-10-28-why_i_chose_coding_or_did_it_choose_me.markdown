I guess I can't say with certainty who started the relationship with who. Was it me or was it coding? I'm not sure. 

But really, how I actually ended up here:

> 1. I've realized I have more years left to work before I can retire than years I've been on this planet. 
> 2. I've been a Social Worker for the last 10 years and with #1 in mind, I've realized it's been a very long 10 years. I don't have another 33+ years in me in this field.
> 3. My friend discovered coding through her husband, who discovered it through going back to school for finance. My friend then introduced me to coding. 

I'm excited but also scared to make such a big change. Also scaredx2 because this is difficult! So far I have to say I enjoy the challenge and the creativity coding demands. I look forward to my future within web development!
